The inputs and outputs that we use to test the programs are not public (it is recommendable to get accustomed to a true contest dynamic ;-).\n- **Time Limit Exceeded**: Your program tried to run during too much time.\n- **Memory Limit Exceeded**: Your program tried to use more memory than the judger settings.\n- **Output Limit Exceeded**: Your program tried to write too much information. This usually occurs if it goes into a infinite loop. Currently the output limit is 1M bytes.\n- **Runtime Error**: All the other Error on the running phrase will get Runtime Error, such as &acute;segmentation fault&acute;, &acute;floating point exception&acute;, &acute;used forbidden functions&acute;, &acute;tried to access forbidden memories&acute; and so on.\n- **Presentation Error**: Your output format is not exactly the same as the judger&acute;s output, although your answer to the problem is correct. Check your output for spaces, blank lines, etc against the problem output specification.\n- **Compile Error**: The compiler (gcc, g++, fpc, etc) could not compile your program. Of course, warning messages are not error messages. The judger reply the actual error message.\n- **System Error**: Internal error occurred in the judger. Please [report this bug](https**://github.com/zjhzxhz/voj/issues) to us.
voj.misc.help.compile-error-reason = Reason for Compile Error
voj.misc.help.compile-error-content = For Java, the class name must be &acute;Main&acute;.\n\nThere are some differences between GNU and MS-VC++, such as:\n\n- main must be declared as int, void main will end up with a Compile Error.\n- i is out of definition after block &acute;for (int i = 0...) {...}&acute;.\n- itoa is not an ANSI function.\n- __int64 of VC is not ANSI, but you can use long long for 64-bit integer.\n
